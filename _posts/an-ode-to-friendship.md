title: "An ode to friendship"
excerpt: "I think reading makes me lose myself. It makes me sad. It makes me feel the emotions I wouldn’t likely experience in a lifetime. Death of a lover, killing someone, morbid truths about life, slowly going insane."

Sometimes feminism could mean appreciating the women in your life.

Sometimes feminism is not judging yourself harshly – for being a bad daughter, bad sister, or a bad partner. 

Sometimes feminism could mean smiling at that other girl in class who sits alone or complimenting others on how nice they look today. 

Most of the time, feminism for me means being kinder to my sex, not judging them too quickly, not laughing when my father and brother jest about my mother’s socio-anxiety, validating my mother’s anger when something goes awry, and listening patiently when other people make haste to advise. 

Female friendships are one of the clichés in modern representation, the jealousy, the bitch, the boyfriend stealer – the villainess. Unsurprisingly, many female friendships (albeit influenced by media or mainstream representation) are toxic rather than fulfilling. 

A masterpiece engineered by patriarchy where women: 

1. Are conditioned to be better than others
2. Fight for the man (when he is the problem) 
3. Be the quietest and gentlest and most beautiful 
4. Conditioned that marriage is ultimately their greatest achievement 

It pains me and so many others who understand the intricate trap we have fallen into, and how it affects our lives. Elders in the family condemn their daughters-in-law and daughters married out of the family for drinking (while turning a blind eye to men drinking because – men are men?) and women looking at other women as competition. For what exactly? None of them know. None of them care or think. 

I am fortunate to have friendships that transcend the boundary of societal conditioning, where listening to others' woes doesn’t mean laughing at her, or spreading bad rumors behind her, where acceptance rings in abundance and all small whims are allowed. I am fortunate to have friends who understand it is not okay to joke about someone’s weight, physical appearance, race, religion, gender, or personality. 

We are fortunate enough to think – and understand that what we observe in society is not absolute truth. 

We are fortunate enough not to be ‘not like other girls’ because there is nothing bad in liking pink or blue, wearing makeup or short dresses, high heels, and wearing crop tops. 

Friendships where we understand each other when there is a moment too quiet and a moment too dreamy when the eyes trail in pain or love. 

How can one create such a friendship? 

Judge a little less. Talk a little more. Listen a lot. Maybe it is as easy as that, for everything in life and not just friendship.
