She is a fairy  
Making everyone Happy around her  
Staying in there every misery

She is a fairy  
Bringing happiness to her surrounding  
Unknowingly like it's her responsibility...

She is a fairy   
suffocating through the hardships  
Yet never giving up on her destiny 

She is a fairy  
Letting everyone know they're loved  
When they think they aren't worthy 

She is a fairy  
Strongest among all  
Yet feeling to give up on her existence 

She is a fairy  
Having smile on her face for her family  
Yet crying in the corner of her room  
holding the pain to herself in agony

She is a fairy  
Aching in her chest  
Feeling suffocating in her hardships  
to calm down her own anxiety taking deep breaths 

She is a fairy  
Happiest among all dancing & singing  
in her own fantasy heaven   
While still grieving in her dark reality.
