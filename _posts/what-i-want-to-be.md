I am what i want to be

They considered me as burden  
Now i am fully independent

They perceived me as sinner  
Now i hold a trophy of winner

They suppressed my pain in silence  
Now i roar with my words in grievance

They told that i am not a lady of manner  
Now i am a woman of all the worldly glamour

They were building for me a slavery World  
Now i am a ruler of my own Universe 

They were passing their rules on me  
Now i am breaking them all and being free

Now look how little they matter  
Because i am making myself better and better

I will become whatever i want to be  
And they hold no power to me

I am atheist of patriarchy and worshipper of feminism  
I am human who bleeds and still stands on their expectations

I am my own manifestation  
My life is my own creation

I am quiet, i am loud  
I am broken, i am healed  
I am angry, i am numb  
I am sober, i am drunk  

I am what i want to be
