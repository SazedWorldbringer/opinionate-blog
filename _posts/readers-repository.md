I fell in love with reading because I wanted to find myself. 


I think reading makes me lose myself. It makes me sad. It makes me feel the emotions I wouldn’t likely experience in a lifetime. Death of a lover, killing someone, morbid truths about life, slowly going insane. 


It might happen to me. But it might not. 


What does it mean to read in this age and time? 


What symbolism? What analogies? What phrases? 


A part of me cannot stop once I start reading, once I am engrossed in the stories some stranger in another part of the world wrote down in a shower, in heartbreak, in a café, in mourning, in raging – in the flight of unknown I could never know. 


Often, when I close the book, kindle, or paperback, I have no thoughts, no whirlwind of emotions, and occasionally tears in between the chapters but endings don’t make me sad. They don’t leave me feeling – ah, I am sad it ended. 


I know everything is supposed to end. 


But the urge to get up and pace around the room with; the thoughts of the characters, the brilliance of the prose, and the palpitation of knowing the fate of those characters who themselves might not know. Their lives lay bare for our entertainment. For us to prod and conclude and despise. 


As a reader, I want to be a writer. 


As a writer, I want to read more. 


It is not easy to file the books I read within the shelves of my heart, scattered because they don’t fit in sessions I couldn’t make – they sit there until I recall them. They wait until I pick them up again. Either to love or hate or to build a friendship or to draw reference or in fond remembrance of who I was once. 


Does this analogy have a purpose? 


Perhaps. 


Perhaps it doesn’t have one. 


Anyhow, it is better than yelling into a void of what I could feel but can’t experience. The wonders of reading never fail to cease me. And maybe they won’t ever. No matter how old and sad I get.
