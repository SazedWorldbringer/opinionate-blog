Feminists are humans: the people who want everyone to be treated as humans

Feminism has no single definition. But let me tell you, feminism is certainly not only for betterment of women. 
Have you heard people saying "Don't cry like a girl" or "Be strong! You are a boy" or everyone's favourite "Be a man". So what does being a man look like? Powerful? Provider? Breadwinner?

You are asked to imagine someone holding a little crying baby while cooking, then serving the food to the family members and feeding the children too, cleaning the dishes when everyone is done eating. Did your mind imagine this person as woman? Why? Why didn't you picture a man here? 

So that's how being a woman look like? doing housechore? Cooking? Crying? Taking care of children and family? Sacrificing?
Yes, that's a pretty thing to serve your family. So why men feel inferior to do it? 

Because you are bombarded with beliefs of patriarchy since your birth. We are taught to follow rules of being "woman" and "man". And we will force the same rules onto next generation. We will appreciate women sacrificing their lives for family. 
We will suppress men's emotions. We will carry this generational trauma. All human beings will die following unreasonable rules throughout their lives...untill we understand what feminism is. Feminism is a way out from unperceptive  suffering of fitting into judgemental society. We need feminism to let people live without labels as 'man' and 'woman' but with identity which they create by their efforts.

Feminist is not a rebellion against man. Feminist is questioner of patriarchal rules and a human who wants to make world a better place for all humans.
