Are your thoughts what your mind thinks?  
Reels, shorts, stories, likes, shares  
We’re the most connected we’ve ever been, yet we face a loneliness pandemic  
Are your tears what your eyes seek?  
Can we overcome loneliness by friendship, or is love a necessary evil  
What is love?  
What is the love you want?  
Is it the company of a loved one during a rainy afternoon, is it a blessing of a priest after a prayer, is it the kiss of goodnight from a parent, is it a comforting hand on your shoulder during a tough time, is it all, or is it none?  
What do we seek in living?  
A thrill? An experience? Happiness?  
Are your thoughts what your mind thinks? Or is your mind made up of your thoughts?  
What is poetry? What is art? What is necessary to live, not just survive? Why do we ask questions we know we won’t get the answers of?  
If all we seek is happiness, then wouldn’t it be best to live in a simulation, where we are guaranteed one?  
What is a question if only answered by yourself? Does that represent your mind, your thoughts?  
How can we say we’re alive? How can we say that we’re here, or that we have been here? Is there evidence of reality?  
Why do we ask questions we know we won't get the answers of?

### Process: 

Recently I had been disconnected from my thoughts and subsequently from my art. I wanted to write poetry the way I started to love it, to help me think. And so I wrote and added all the questions I had in my head at that time in it. Some were long due, some came as I was writing, some were added/repeated for poetic effect. All in all, this was just a reflection of what I was thinking at that moment, hence the name as well.
