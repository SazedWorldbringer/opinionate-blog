I'm 20. I will be 21 in two months which sound like a lot of time but is it? People change everyday. And yet some things never do change. In next 4 years, my brain will be fully developed with its complex connections ever-expanding - in layman's terms; my brain would 'stop growing.' I am not certain of the causality of the extend but it renews the urgency to define me and who I am. Learn as much I can along the way because learning new things is hard as an adult - you just adapt and improvise rather than learn. 

With this realization, a new kind of resolution has crept in. 

A desire to be an adult who does not forget. 

This idea, unabashedly, put within my neural network by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's 'The Little Prince.' A tale of adulthood from a child's perspective. It is a timeless classic that continues to reveal truths of the human connection, sensibility, critical thinking and compassion. 

The work could be analysed with its elements of absurd; the mystery of how different adults are engaged in mindless, repetative or meaningless tasks every single day. A true reflection of our current futility of life which no longer has any definite meaning. 

I've got a terrible memory so I think I will forget I was once a child like all adults do. A child filled with dreams and aspirations my current self classifies as 'impossibilities.' One thing has never changed though, a large part of me is still a blank slate. I used to get discouraged easily, get influenced easily, chased perfection, wanted to know everything - a high achiever dream. 

But there was nothing I truly wanted to become. 

Maybe that's why I started reading - to find out what I can be. Not what I am. Then I forgot.
I forgot why I started to read because it became a job for me. Bookstagram became toxic, reviews became priority than actually enjoying the process of reading. If I didn't read 80 books every year, I am a failure. 

But did I ever find out what I wanted to be. No. Does it matter? Maybe. I can't tell that right now. It is a bit more difficult to judge yourself. You have to be kind and objective and patient and forgiving all the same time. In this moment, I would pursue whatever catches my interest, tell myself it is okay to do multiple things and not meet targets or deadline. 

That's the kind of adult I want to be. And I hope I continue to remain. Not a responsible one. Not a fun one but someone who remembers both good and bad times, mistakes and improvement and everything in between that mattered. 

An adult who never forgot she was once a child and loved things - simply and deeply. 

Is that vague? Yes, and no. For the future is full of unlimited possibilities and potential will be left unexplored if we forget. 

Where is fun in that?
