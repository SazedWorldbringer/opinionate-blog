The biggest mistake I have made is believing that something that is obvious to me is obvious to everyone. And I realised that mistake last March when we tried to host an open mic, 'Feminism Decoded'. For which, we asked students on campus what feminism was for them. Whenever I asked someone - "Are you a feminist?", they would say no, with the expression that I was asking them if they were cannibals. 
I remember getting one answer:"Why not human rights or equalism?". I genuinely wanted to answer back: then why not the word feminism? What was wrong with using the word Feminism? Because, of course, feminism might fall under human rights. Feminists believe in equality too, but isn't equality a wide concept? What is wrong with attending to problems specifically associated with gender? Denying feminism is also ignoring injustices happening to any gender and letting a gender get targeted with societal stereotypes. 

To sow a seed of good thought is a challenge, especially in a double-standard society where freedom of speech is a birthright but people get offended by untraditional opinions. At least, the first two waves of feminism knew what they were fighting against. Today, it has become much more difficult to know due to the hypocritical side of society. 
Once, my friend, female at that, was sharing how a man creep stared at her, and she felt so judged. The next moment, she herself was judging a girl wearing a tank top, "If she wears such a dress, it's valid for boys to creep stare at her." What was she validating? 
Another one -  I was talking to a pandit uncle, and he said that Feminism isn't new; it was written in our 'shastra' a long time ago that - यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते रमन्ते तत्र देवताः। यत्रैतास्तु न पूज्यन्ते सर्वास्तत्राफलाः क्रियाः।।
I was sitting there, listening to how conditional that sounded. One should respect women if they want to please God or have betterment? Secondly, didn't he think about why it was necessary to write a separate Shloka on respecting women? (And Keeping that aside) The next moment, the pandit uncle started talking (in front of me) about how society is getting ruined from the time when women started stepping outside the threshold. They can stay in the house, take care of kids—what's the need to become social? My innocent heart shattered into pieces. How doubled faced can this man be? This is how they respect women? It is sad. We live in a society where "don't talk to strangers", is said, but marrying a stranger is fair. 

"And as humans, we’re by-products of our upbringings, victims of our lacklustre educational systems, and choosers of our behaviors. In short, the reduction of women to something less than men and the elevation of men to something more than women are not biological; they're cultural. And it starts with two words: pink and blue. Everything skyrockets out of control from there.” Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry.
Girls aren't bad at math; some individuals are. Boys aren't bad at parenting; some individuals are. It's not extraordinary for boys to cook; it's not extraordinary for girls to be entrepreneurs of a non-fashion brand. 

When a person asked me why feminism, I didn't answer back because I didn't think of the person as worth explaining. But definitely it's worth expressing, because feminism is a wonderful word. It's not the fight against man, or patriarchy isn't even the highlight here; it's just common sense. Feminism is voicing your opinion freely without getting into a bad relationship with anyone. Feminism is not about teaching men to respect women but about educating everyone to respect everyone. Feminism is appreciating personalities and works regardless of gender. Feminism is being unashamed of who you are. Feminism can be subjective.
 For me, it's the realisation that yes, gender problems are real, and we can change them with small steps. 'Feminism' is a wonderful word, and it should be taken like that! 

Then, what makes feminism such a hateful word? We are in an overly informational era. When I asked one of my male friends, Why not feminism? He answered, How the YouTuber was talking about fake rape cases and how much privilege women get due to them. (surprisingly, he didn't think of 86 registered plus limitless unregistered rape cases noted per day.)

Social media can be a very huge medium of expression. One can get all kinds of opinions through it, but it's in your hands to decide what you believe. The power of questioning, not blindly believing, is still with you. One must know that hitting a woman is not unconditional love; it's called 'domestic violence'. The myths of feminism are deeply rooted in society, let us sort myths from real feminism.

I hope that every day we can work towards creating a world where women or men don't need a special day to be celebrated and respected.
