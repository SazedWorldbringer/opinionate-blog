The biggest mistake I have done was to believe that something which is obvious to me was obvious to everyone. And I realised that mistake when last March we tried to host an open mic - 'Feminism Decoded'. For which, we tried to talk to students around our campus and ask them what feminism was for them. Whenever I asked someone this question - Are you a feminist, they would say NO, with an expression that I was asking them if they are cannibal. 
What was feminism for them? 
I remember getting one answer, why not human rights or equalism. I genuinely wanted thought then Why not the word feminism? 
Obviously, Feminism might come under human rights, yes we believe in equality but its a wide concept. Why we shouldnt attend problems associated with gender specifically? Denying feminism is also  ignoring injustices happening on any gender, letting a gender get targeted with societal stereotypes. 

Atleast the first 2 waves of Feminism knew what they are fighting against. Today, it has become much more difficult due to the hypocritical side of society. 
Once, my friend, female at that, was sharing how a man creep stared her and she felt so judged - the next moment she was judging a girl wearing a tank top on how could she wear such a dress and that's the reason why boys will creep stare her. 
Once, I was talking to a pandit uncle and then he said that Feminism isn't new, it was written in our 'shastra' a long time ago that - यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते रमन्ते तत्र देवताः। यत्रैतास्तु न पूज्यन्ते सर्वास्तत्राफलाः क्रियाः।। I was sitting there,  listening, on how conditional it is to respect woman or else gods won't be happy at you? Secondly, Why was it necessary to write a seperate shlok on respecting women? Although keeping that aside, the next moment the pandit uncle started (in front of me) that the society is getting ruined from the moment when women started stepping out of threshold. They can stay in house, take care of kids, what's the need to become social. 
My innocent heart shattered into pieces - how doubled faced can one be? This is the way to respect women? 

Feminism is voicing your opinion freely without getting in a bad relation with anyone.  Feminism is not about teaching man to respect woman but educating everyone to respect everyone. Feminism is appreciating personalities, and works regardless of gender. Feminism can be subjective. 
For me it's the realisation that yes gender problem are real and we can change it with small steps. Feminism is being unashamed of who you are. 
'Feminism' is a wonderful word, and it should be taken like that! 

Then, What makes feminism such a hatred word? We are in an overly informational era. When I asked one of my male friends why not feminism? He answered how the youtuber was talking about fake rape case and how much privileges women get due to it. Sounds pretty hurtful in average 86 REGISTERED rape cases per day right? 
Social media can be a very huge medium of expression. One can get all kinds of opinions through it, but it's in your hand what you believe. The power of questioning (not blindly believing) is still with you. You should know that hitting a woman is not unconditional love, it's called assault. The myths of Feminism are deep rooted in society, let us sort myths from real feminism.

Girls aren't bad at maths, some individuals are. Boys aren't bad at parenting, some individuals are. It's not extraordinary for boys to cook, it's not extraordinary for girls to drive a four wheeler.
I hope that every day we can work towards creating a world where women or men don't need a special day to be celebrated and respected.
